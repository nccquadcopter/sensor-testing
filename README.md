# Please create a separate folder for each individual sensor so we can keep track of them.

To create a new folder in a repository click “create a new file.” Type your new folder's name in the area where you would write the file name, and at the end of the file name type a “/” to initilize it as a folder. After this you can create a new file in the folder.
